# How to create a Candlestick chart


The following example demonstrates how to create a [Candlestick](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/2988/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/series-views/2d-series-views/financial-series-views/candle-stick-chart) chart at runtime. Note that this series view type is associated with the [XY-Diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5908/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/chart-elements/diagram/diagram-types/xy-diagram) type, and you should cast your [diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5778/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/chart-elements/diagram) object to this type, in order to access its specific options.
